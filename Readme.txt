Change Log
----------------------

 [*] Fixed location of Dragonmaw Retreat: I had listed it mistakenly as being in Grim Reaches, but it's located in Wetlands.

2.0.7 - Update (Spartelfant)
 [*] Fixed bug in workaround for game bug. I previously used string.match() which is not available in-game, but during testing I had another addon active that made this function available, which is why I did not catch this.

2.0.6 - Update (Spartelfant)
 [*] Added workaround for game bug that prevented the new Northwind zone from showing a tooltip: The game included a trailing space, so the actual zone name is 'Northwind '.

 [*] New zones added for patch 1.18 (Grim Reaches, Northwind, Balor)
